# NLocalizer
NLocalizer is a class library for C# and VB.NET developers to localize their Classic Desktop Application projects using text files, so there will be no need to recompile the project to add a new language or to modify the existing one. This project is a fork of original [NLocalizer](http://nlocalizer.codeplex.com) on CodePlex.
